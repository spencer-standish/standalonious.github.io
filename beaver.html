                The North American beaver is a semiaquatic animal native to North America. 
                Its coat is repellent with a shiny, rich, blackish-brown to russet color. 
                The underlayer of hair is tighter and more protective than the outer layer. 
                Ears usually have an amber color, being round and short. When a beaver walks, 
                the front part of its body is closer to the ground than the rear, due to its 
                front legs being shorter than its hind legs.

                Before their near-extirpation by trapping in North America, 
                these animals lived from south of the arctic tundra to the 
                deserts of northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. 
                They are widely distributed in boreal and temperate ecoregions, 
                where populations are rebounding from historic over-exploitation. 
                Recently, American beavers have been observed colonizing arctic tundra, 
                likely as a result of climate-induced increases in riparian shrubs.

            <p id="life_p">
                American beavers are highly sociable animals. They make up colonies - family groups of about 
                8 individuals in each one - and live within a hierarchy. Beavers are very territorial, 
                protecting their home range from other beaver colonies. The period of their highest activity 
                is the nighttime, though sometimes they can be seen in the daytime, more frequently in the 
                twilight. In search of food, beavers are ready to pass long distances. When the source of 
                food is found, a beaver opens water canals to it in order to transport the food across the 
                water to its lodge. Beavers also pile up branches and sticks under the water as winter supply. 
                In areas of fast water flow beavers construct dams to slow down the stream. Their lodges are 
                very firm to be able to serve as shelters. Beavers construct dams, depending on the speed of 
                the water stream: if the stream is strong, dams are built in a way so as to withstand the 
                pressure of water flow and not be washed away.

            <p id="diet_p">
                American beavers are herbivores and lignivores; they feed on the bark of trees and cambium 
                - the inner layer, which is under the bark. The favorite trees include willows, aspen trees, 
                alders, maples, and birches. Along with these, beavers feed upon aquatic plants 
                meanwhile not missing roots and buds.

                <h3>Population threats</h3>
                <p>
                    Beavers attract hunters for their pelts. On the other hand, near human settlements, 
                    beavers are killed for building dams and destroying trees, thus disturbing human life. 
                    In addition, beavers are susceptible to tularemia - an animal disease, common in North America. 
                    And finally, a human disturbance may put beavers in real danger: people kill them for pelts 
                    and persecute them from their habitat, not speaking about pollution, which promotes wound infection.
                </p>
                <h3>Population number</h3>
                <p>
                    The IUCN Red List and other sources don't provide the number of the American beaver total 
                    population size. Currently, this species is classified as Least Concern (LC) on the 
                    IUCN Red List and its numbers today are stable.
                </p>
                <h3>Ecological niche</h3>
                <p>
                    The American beaver lives in marshy areas which slow down water streams in a case of a 
                    flood. The beaver hinders soil erosion and promotes water level rise. Sludge occurs 
                    upstream of the dikes thus putting toxins out of action. Ponds start to grow from water, 
                    supported by dams, after which lilies appear. And then, when the lodges are left by beavers, 
                    eventually the dams start decaying, giving way to meadows.
