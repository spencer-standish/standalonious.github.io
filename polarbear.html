                Polar bears are one of few large mammals that have been able to adapt well to life on the ice. 
                Their fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent. 
                The white coat usually yellows with age. The feet of these massive animals are very large to distribute load when walking on 
                snow or thin ice and to provide propulsion when swimming; they may measure 30 cm (12 in) across in an adult. 
                The pads of the paws are covered with small, soft papillae (dermal bumps), which provide traction on the ice. 
                The claws are deeply scooped on the underside to assist in digging in the ice of the natural habitat.

                Polar bears are found in the Arctic Circle and adjacent land masses as far south as Newfoundland. 
                While they are rare north of 88Â°, there is evidence that they range all the way across the Arctic,
                and as far south as James Bay in Canada. Their range includes the territory of five nations: 
                Denmark (Greenland), Norway (Svalbard), Russia, the United States (Alaska), and Canada. 
                Polar bears prefer to live on the annual sea ice covering the waters over the continental shelf 
                and the Arctic inter-island archipelagos. These areas, known as the "Arctic ring of life", 
                have high biological productivity in comparison to the deep waters of the high Arctic. 
                Polar bears frequent the areas where sea ice meets water, such as polynyas and leads 
                (temporary stretches of open water in Arctic ice), to hunt the seals that make up most of their diet.

                Polar bears live a solitary life. They may come into competition with each other when there is the chance to scavenge when a seal is killed. 
                In such cases, the smaller bear usually runs away. Polar bears can dive underwater to catch their prey, keeping their eyes open while holding
                their breath for as much as 2 minutes. They are inactive for a good part of the time, lying, sleeping, or waiting (still hunting). The rest of
                the time is usually spent traveling, either walking or swimming, feeding or stalking prey. They may travel far in search of food. 
                Polar bears are usually quiet but do communicate with various sounds and vocalizations. Females communicate with their young with 
                moans and chuffs, and the distress calls of both cubs and subadults consist of bleats. Cubs may hum while nursing. When nervous, 
                bears produce huffs, chuffs, and snorts while hisses, growls, and roars are signs of aggression. Chemical communication can also 
                be important: bears leave behind their scent in their tracks allowing individuals to keep track of each other.

                Most of what Polar bears eat is the blubber and skids of Ringed seals. They often leave the rest of the carcass, which becomes
                an important food source for other animals. They also eat birds, fish, berries, reindeer and sometimes walrus. Carcasses of 
                walruses, seals and even whales can provide a regular source of food for Polar bears. They sometimes break into underground 
                seal dens to hunt the pups inside them.

                <h3>Population threats</h3>
                <p>
                    Polar bears are still hunted for fur and meat by the Arctic's native peoples. They are also threatened by drilling for gas and oil,
                    increased shipping activity, and pollution from industrial chemicals. But the major threat is climate change and global warming 
                    causing the sea ice to melt earlier in the year and forcing the bears to shore before they have built sufficient fat reserves to 
                    survive the period of scarce food. It is suggested that Polar bears could be extinct in the wild within the next 30 years.
                </p>
                <h3>Population number</h3>
                <p>
                    According to IUCN, as of 2010, between 22,000-31,000 Polar bears are estimated to be roaming near to the North Pole, 
                    most being in northern Canada. Currently, this species is classified as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List.
                </p>
                <h3>Ecological niche</h3>
                <p>
                    Polar bears are the top Arctic carnivores. The remains of seals left by the bears are likely to be an 
                    important food source for younger, less experienced bears and Arctic foxes.
