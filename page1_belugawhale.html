              The beluga is also called the white whale because of its milky
              white skin and is the only whale species that is completely white.
              It is gray when born and this color fades gradually with age. It
              is small in size and lacks a dorsal fin. Belugas are toothed
              whales, with flexible lips that can produce a range of facial
              expressions. They have wide, paddle-like flippers and notches in
              their tails. Their necks are extremely flexible and they can turn
              their heads almost 90 degrees sideways. Their extremely thick
              layer of blubber provides insulation in freezing Arctic waters.
              Their bodies are fifty percent fat, much higher than other
              non-Arctic whales, with a body fat of only twenty percent.

            <h2>Distribution</h2>
            <p>
              Belugas are widely distributed in the Arctic and subarctic. Some
              North American populations are strongly migratory and are
              identified by their summer grounds (e.g., Beaufort Sea, Lancaster
              Sound-Barrow Strait-Prince Regent Inlet region, and eastern and
              western Hudson Bay). Others tend to remain in the same region
              year-round, making primarily local movements (e.g., Cook Inlet,
              Bristol Bay, Cumberland Sound and St. Lawrence estuary). Belugas
              are often found near ice and in or near river mouths. They are
              social animals and sometimes form aggregations of hundreds or even
              thousands of individuals.

            <h2>Habitat and Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>
              Beluga whales are diurnal and very social animals. During summer,
              thousands of them gather together in river estuaries to molt. They
              rub their bodies on the gravel of the sea bed to shed their
              yellow, withered skin from the previous year and to again become
              gleaming white. At this time, females with babies will often group
              together, while males gather in large bachelor groups. Belugas are
              able to dive deeper than 1,000 m, but usually, they are found upon
              the surface, swimming slowly. During winter it may become
              necessary to form breathing holes amongst the ice, which they do
              with their heavy heads. Belugas are among the most vocal
              cetaceans. They use their vocalizations for echolocation, during
              mating, and for communication. They possess a large repertoire,
              emitting up to 11 different sounds, such as cackles, whistles,
              trills, and squawks.

            <h2>Population</h2>
            <h3>Population threats</h3>
            <p>
              Hunting by Inuit and Alaska Native groups is the biggest known
              threat to belugas across certain portions of their range. Further
              threats are contamination of river estuaries, infectious diseases,
              and disturbance by vessel transport, gas, and oil production. An
              increasing concern is a noise, which can damage a whale’s hearing
              and affect its ability to navigate, communicate, and locate prey.
            </p>
            <h3>Population number</h3>
            <p>
              According to the IUCN Red List, the total size of the beluga whale
              population is 136,000 mature individuals. Currently, this species
              is classified as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List.

            <h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2>
            <p>
              Belugas are carnivores (piscivores, molluscivores) and eat a
              variety of prey, such as smelt, flatfish, flounder, salmon,
              sculpins, and cod. They also eat invertebrates such as crabs,
              clams, shrimps, worms, octopus, squid, and more creatures that
              live on the seabed.

          <div class="matingpara">
            <h2>Mating Habits</h2>
            <p>
              Beluga whales are polygynous, a dominant male often mating with
              several females during one mating season. The mating season takes
              place between late February and early April. Gestation lasts 14
              months and a single calf is produced. The calf has a grayish color
              and is very well developed. The nursery pod stays together during
              the delivery, then all of them move off except for a teenage
              nursemaid. Birthing usually takes place near rivers because the
              temperature of the water is ten degrees higher there. This is for
              the benefit of the calf, which has less blubber than a full-grown
              adult. The newborn stays between the two females, their swimming
              pulling him along with the current. A calf totally depends on its
              mother’s milk for one year, and lactation lasts as long as 1.5 to
              2 years. Females become reproductively mature in 4 to 7 years, and
              males in 7 to 9 years of age.

            <h2>Fun Facts For Kids</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Beluga whale offspring return to places where they have been
                with their mothers, who they remember and bond with year after
                year.
              </li>
              <li>
                Belugas are called "canaries of the sea," due to the vast range
                of sounds they produce, including whistles, squeals, moos,
                clicks, and chirps. Besides vocal communication they also
                communicate by means of rubbing or bumping against each other,
                chasing each other, and playing games.
              </li>
              <li>
                Beluga whales' dives can go as deep as 800 meters and may be for
                up to 25 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>Belugas can swim backward.</li>
              <li>
                Belugas can alter the shape of their forehead, known as a
                "melon", by means of blowing air around their sinuses
              </li>
              <li>
                Belugas are able to see within and outside of water, but their
                vision is relatively poor when compared to dolphins.
