              The Brown bear is a large mammal with a notable hump of muscles
              over its shoulders. This animal is the second largest species of
              bear. The legs of Brown bear are strong with huge paws. Their
              claws are rather long on their front feet, allowing them to dig
              their dens as well as dig for food. The ears are relatively small
              and the face is concave while the head is large with powerful
              jaws. Brown bears have ability of standing and walking on their
              hind legs; they do so in order to determine location of a food
              source or to identify a threat. These animals have thick coat,
              varying in color from black to brown and blonde. The guard hair of
              these animals is longer, sometimes having white tip, which gives
              them grizzled appearance.

            <p>
              These bears are found in very small numbers from North America to
              Western Europe, Palestine, Eastern Siberia and Himalayan region.
              The habitat of the Brown bear is usually riparian areas. These
              bears live along rivers and streams in prairies, alpine meadows,
              woodlands and forests.

            <h2>Habitat and Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>
              The brown bear is a territorial animal, leading solitary life. The
              bears usually forage in mornings and evenings, resting in cover by
              day; however, they are active at any time of the day. They spend
              the winter months in dens, entering a dormant state. Brown bears
              are not full hibernators, so can be woken at any time. Their dens
              are usually caves, hollow logs or crevices. From time to time,
              Brown bears congregate into large groups to feed. The groups have
              social hierarchy system, based on age and size. With coming of the
              autumn, some individuals travel hundreds of kilometers in search
              of a suitable source of food.

            <h2>Population</h2>
            <h3>Population threats</h3>
            <p>
              The major threats include habitat loss and fragmentation through
              the extension of human habitat: highways and settlements together
              with development of agriculture bring to decrease of their
              habitat. In addition, due to hunting on sheep and cattle, these
              animals have been persecuted by humans as predators of domestic
              livestock. Also, these bears are occasionally hunted for sport. On
              the other hand, some isolated populations of Brown bear are
              threatened with adverse genetic affects. And finally, these
              animals are poached for their paws and gall bladders that have
              high commercial value.
            </p>
            <h3>Population number</h3>
            <p>
              The population of the Brown bear is currently stable and not
              endangered. In the IUCN Red List, the species is classified as
              Least Concern (LC). The global population is more than 200,000
              individuals with about 100,000 of them living in Russia and 14,000
              in the rest of Europe. Other countries with a large number of
              population include US (33,000) and Canada (25,000).
            </p>
            <h3>Ecological Niche</h3>
            <p>
              On one hand, being predators, these animals control prey species.
              On the other hand, they play important role in the ecosystem,
              dispersing seeds and thus sustaining the environment.

            <h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2>
            <p>
              Brown bears are omnivores. What they eat largely depends on what
              kind of food is available at a particular season. Thus, in the
              spring they feed on grass and shoots, in the summer they eat
              berries and apples while in the autumn they consume nuts and
              plums. In addition, they eat reptiles, insects, roots and honey.
              Brown bears, living in the Canadian Rockies, feed upon mammals
              such as moose or elk whereas those in Alaska eat salmon in the
              summer.

            <h2>Mating Habits</h2>
            <p>
              Brown bears are serially monogamous, living with the same mate
              from several days to several weeks. During this time, the male
              competes with other males in the area, protecting the female from
              them. During the breeding season, which lasts from May to July, a
              female can mate with multiple males – behavior, that can be
              characterized as polygynandry. The period of gestation lasts 8
              weeks, yielding 1-4 cubs. The cubs are ready to start foraging
              with their mother. The female breastfeed them until spring. For
              2-4 years, the mother teaches the cub's survival techniques: the
              babies learn where to den, how to hunt, and how to defend
              themselves. Males do not mate until they are able to compete with
              other males in the area for mating rights while females reach
              sexual maturity at 5-7 years old.

          <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
          <div id="accordion">
            <h3>Fact 1</h3>
            <div>
              Brown bears use their claws to dig comfortable caves, where they
              spend the winter. As they enter a dormant state, their heartbeats
              drop to 10 beats per minute.
            </div>
            <h3>Fact 2</h3>
            <div>
              Females of Brown bear give birth during the winter, being asleep.
              Newborn cubs feed upon maternal milk and warm in fur of their
              mother until the spring comes, and the female wakes up to see her
              babies.
            </div>
            <h3>Fact 3</h3>
            <div>
              These animals are highly intelligent: they use tools in their
              daily life from hunting to playing; they have large brain,
              compared to their body size; they have good memory and excellent
              navigation skills.
            </div>
            <h3>Fact 4</h3>
            <div>
              They are able to smell cubs, a mate, predators or food from as far
              as miles away. In addition, they have excellent eyesight, which
              helps them identify ripe fruits.
            </div>
            <h3>Fact 5</h3>
            <div>The Brown bear is the national animal of Finland.</div>
            <h3>Fact 6</h3>
            <div>
              The Brown bear is also a European Protected Species, having
              protection in the countries of the European Union.
