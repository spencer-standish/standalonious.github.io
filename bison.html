                American bison is a large ungulate mammal that once roamed North America in vast herds. 
                The color of its fur varies in the front and back of its body and is different shades of brown. 
                Bison is hunchbacked and it has a long beard on its chin. The forehead is wide and narrow while 
                the neck is short. Hind legs are smaller than front legs, making up a scarp from humpback to tail. 
                Length of hair differs in front and rear, especially in males: front hair is significantly longer than rear hair. 
                Horns of bison are black, bent inward withal upward and pointed.

                In the past, a huge number of bison thundered North America from Mexico to Alaska. 
                Then, mass killings of these impressive animals led to their total extermination 
                from the main area of their habitat. However, bison survived and currently they 
                live primarily in Canada and the western part of the USA, usually in protected 
                areas and national parks. American bison prefer to inhabit river valleys, prairies, 
                and plains. Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, 
                semiarid lands, and scrublands. Bison also graze in hilly or mountainous areas 
                where the slopes are not steep.

            <p id="life_p">
                American bison is diurnal, being active all day long. They are usually relatively 
                passive during the day, becoming particularly active at dusk and dawn. They spend 
                a lot of time cleaning the fur or grooming: they rub their head, sides, and necks 
                against trunks of trees. Bison are able to be constantly on the move, passing long 
                distances as long as there is food. Cows, female bison, are leaders of family groups 
                while males stay separate, creating small groups or living solitarily. As the mating 
                season comes, males join female groups. Bison like rolling, weltering, and rubbing 
                against the ground. Wallows are recesses - dust bowls with no vegetation, having 
                circular form, formed as a result of bison's wallowing on the ground.

            <p id="diet_p">
                Bison are herbivores (graminivores) and, more specifically, grazers, chewing grass 
                all year round. However, in absence of grass, they eat other greenery found in the 
                area such as sagebrush. The presence of water is another important component of their 
                life: they can't last long without a source of water.

                <h3>Population threats</h3>
                <p>
                    The most notable threats to the population of this species as a whole are 
                    long-time persecution of bison from their habitat; slow growth of population 
                    in closed and protected areas; genetic manipulation in commercial purposes; 
                    hybridization and back crossing of bison and other cattle as well as between 
                    different bison subspecies; natural limiting factors in conditions of reservations; 
                    and the possible threat of depopulations of bison because of its wild populations' 
                    carrying cattle deceases; continuous culling of bison in order to preclude 
                    brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis infection.
                </p>
                <h3>Population number</h3>
                <p>
                    According to the IUCN Red List resource, the total population size of the 
                    American bison is around 31,000 individuals in 68 conservation herds in North America. 
                    The total wild population of the species is estimated to be between 11,248 and 13,123 
                    mature individuals in North America. Currently, the American bison is classified as Near 
                    Threatened (NT) on the IUCN Red List but its numbers today are stable.
                </p>
                <h3>Ecological niche</h3>
                <p>
                    Bison was an important component of the flatlands ecosystem in its habitat. 
                    When grazing, the animal thrusts its hooves into the soil, thus fertilizing it. 
                    Plains, grazed by bison, were inhabited by prairie dogs, protecting them against 
                    predators due to being shorter and thus providing a better view to the surrounding area. 
                    Corpses of bison were a delicacy for scavengers while their meat was the main source 
                    of food for the local population of wolves and humans. Bison fertilized plains of the 
                    habitat thus becoming predecessors of farmers.
